## Setup scripts
- *setup.sh* - Base installation script that symlinks the files to the home directory and installs pure prompt and dein.vim (plugin manager) if they're not already installed.
- *arch-setup.sh* - Arch-specific installation script that installs yaourt (AUR wrapper) and required packages.
